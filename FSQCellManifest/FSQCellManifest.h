 An array of plugins to receive callbacks from the manifest.
 
 The intention of the plugin pattern is to give the ability to add extra functionality to the manifest without
 needing to separately subclass the table and collection view versions, copying code between each. Individual users of 
 the manifest should generally not be creating new plugins every time. It should be treated more like making
 a new subclass.
 
 Each plugin in the array will get the method callbacks in order, giving them a chance to do extra work
 whenever the manifest does an action. Callbacks will be sent in order to items in the array. If the manifest has
 a delegate, it will receive the callbacks last.
